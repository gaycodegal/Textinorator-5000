# Textinorator 5000 License

## Main code

This project is licensed under AGPL 3.0 see LICENSE-AGPL.txt for
more details.

## Service Worker code

The service worker code, which includes:

- ./service-worker.js
- all files under js/service-worker/

is provided under the MIT license (see js/service-worker/LICENSE.txt),
copyright GayCodeGal, 2025. Specifically, this is due to service worker
code being a royal pain to write, and if you need a drop in
"it works" service-worker for your project, the MIT license is
more forgiving.

## Additional Licenses

Any part or whole of this project is subject to being issued under
a different license as the author, GayCodeGal, wishes. All
previous versions of the code still remain available under
whatever license they were issued with, but future versions
may have additional optional licenses.
