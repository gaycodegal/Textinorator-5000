# Textinorator 5000

This is a tool for adding text to images, designed to be usable on mobile offline. I found the current tooling for adding text to images insufficient.

## Desires

- Upload custom fonts (to be cached in browser)
- Stroke
- Background
- Rotation
- Scale

## Proposed controls

- Click on text to swap focus to it
- once focus is on text, drag anywhere to move the text
- click and drag on a corner of focused text to resize it
- perhaps double tap off the current text to add new text
- double tap on current text to swap to rotation mode?
