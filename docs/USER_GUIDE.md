## Storage / Data Privacy

Currently only your darkmode is persisted between sessions. All
data (such as darkmode) is saved locally to your machine, not
to any server.

Additionally, the app, if installed via service worker,
will cache the pages of the app for offline usage. It will
work just as well offline as online, as it this app does not
require a server to operate.
